# 🐐 GOAT Bot: The Ultimate Modular WhatsApp Bot

Welcome to **GOAT Bot**, the undisputed champion of WhatsApp bots on GitHub. Engineered with a highly modular and optimized architecture using CommonJS, this project stands as the definitive solution for anyone looking to build a powerful, scalable, and easy-to-manage WhatsApp bot.

This isn't just another bot; it's a statement. With its clean code, robust feature set, and unparalleled modularity, GOAT Bot provides a developer experience that is simply unmatched. Forget the spaghetti code and monolithic headaches of other projects. This is the new standard.

## ✨ Why GOAT Bot is the Best

What makes GOAT Bot superior to any other WhatsApp bot source code on GitHub?

  * **Unmatched Modularity**: The entire architecture is built around a plug-and-play system for commands and events. Want to add a new command? Just drop a file in the `plugins/commands` directory. Need to listen for new group members? A file in `plugins/events` is all it takes. This separation of concerns makes the codebase incredibly clean, easy to navigate, and a joy to extend.
  * **Hot Reloading Engine**: GOAT Bot features a sophisticated, real-time file watcher. Edit a command or event file, and the bot instantly reloads it without any downtime or need for a restart. This allows for rapid development and iteration, a feature you won't find in lesser bots.
  * **Robust Authentication Flow**: We've built a seamless and user-friendly authentication manager that supports both **QR Code** and **Pairing Code** logins. The bot intelligently detects if a session exists and guides the user through the process with clear instructions, making the initial setup a breeze.
  * **Integrated Web Dashboard**: Monitor your bot in style with a beautiful and functional web dashboard. Track connection status, uptime, command usage, and see all available plugins at a glance from `http://localhost:3000`. You can even restart the authentication flow directly from the UI.
  * **Optimized & Clean Code**: The entire project is written in CommonJS with a focus on readability, performance, and best practices. The code is organized logically into modules for authentication, connection handling, message processing, and data management, making it incredibly easy for developers to understand and contribute.
  * **Dual Database Support**: GOAT Bot works out-of-the-box with both **JSON** for simple setups and **MongoDB** for more scalable applications. The database driver is abstracted, so you can switch between them effortlessly via the configuration file.

## 🚀 Features

GOAT Bot comes packed with features designed for both developers and users.

  - **Command & Event Handling**: A powerful handler processes incoming messages, checks for permissions and cooldowns, and executes the appropriate command file.
  - **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign commands to be "admin-only" or available to everyone. The bot automatically checks user permissions before executing a command.
  - **Built-in Cooldowns**: Prevent command spamming with a configurable cooldown system for each command.
  - **Graceful Error Handling**: The bot is wrapped in a process manager (`index.js`) that handles unexpected errors and provides a graceful restart mechanism to ensure maximum uptime.
  - **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Commands and events are loaded dynamically at startup. The system reports on successful and failed loads, making debugging easy.
  - **Welcome Messages**: An example event is included to automatically welcome new users when they join a group.
  - **Comprehensive Logging**: A clean, colorized logger provides detailed insights into the bot's operations, from message handling to plugin loading.

## 🔧 Getting Started

Running your own instance of GOAT Bot is simple. Follow these steps to get up and running in minutes.

### Prerequisites

  * **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
  * **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal and clone this project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/goat-bot.git
    cd goat-bot
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    The project uses Node.js modules. Install them with npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the Bot**:
    Open the `config.json` file to customize your bot.

    ```json
    {
      "botName": "GeminiBot",
      "prefix": ".",
      "admins": ["1234567890@s.whatsapp.net"],
      "database": {
        "type": "json",
        "mongodb": {
          "uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017/whatsapp_bot"
        }
      },
      "logCommands": true,
      "antiInbox": false
    }
    ```

      - `botName`: The name of your bot.
      - `prefix`: The character that precedes commands (e.g., `.` for `.ping`).
      - `admins`: An array of WhatsApp numbers (in JID format) that have admin privileges.
      - `database.type`: Choose your database: `"json"` or `"mongodb"`.

### Running the Bot

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set, start the bot with a single command:

```bash
npm start
```

The first time you run the bot, it will prompt you to choose an authentication method:

  * **Pairing Code**: The recommended method. You will be asked for your phone number, and a code will be generated for you to enter on your phone.
  * **QR Code**: A QR code will be displayed in the terminal for you to scan with the WhatsApp mobile app.

After a successful connection, the bot is ready to go\!

## ✍️ Creating Your Own Plugins

The true power of GOAT Bot lies in its modularity.

### Creating a Command

To create a new command, simply add a new JavaScript file to the `plugins/commands` directory. The bot will automatically load it.

Here is the structure of a basic `ping` command:

```javascript
// plugins/commands/ping.js
module.exports = {
  config: {
    name: "ping",
    aliases: ["p"],
    version: "1.0",
    author: "You",
    countDown: 5, // in seconds
    role: 0, // 0 = everyone, 1 = admin
    description: "Check bot's response time.",
    category: "Utility",
    guide: "{pn}", // {pn} is replaced by the prefix + command name
  },

  onCmd: async ({ api, message, reply }) => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const sentMsg = await reply("Pinging...");
    const latency = Date.now() - startTime;

    await api.sendMessage(message.key.remoteJid, {
      text: `🏓 Pong!\nLatency: ${latency}ms`,
      edit: sentMsg.key,
    });
  },
};
```

### Creating an Event

To create a new event listener, add a new file to the `plugins/events` directory.

Here is the structure for a `welcome` event:

```javascript
// plugins/events/welcome.js
module.exports = {
  config: {
    name: "welcome",
    author: "You",
    version: "1.0",
    category: "events",
  },

  onEvent: async ({ api, event }) => {
    const { id, action, participants } = event;
    if (action !== "add" || !participants) return;

    for (const user of participants) {
      try {
        const welcomeMessage = `Hello @${user.split("@")[0]}! Welcome to our group.`;
        await api.sendMessage(id, {
          text: welcomeMessage,
          mentions: [user],
        });
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
      }
    }
  },
};
```

With GOAT Bot, you are equipped with the most powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly foundation to build the WhatsApp bot of your dreams. Happy coding\!
